         <p>
        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup
         language used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit. 
         It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wishes it to be.
          HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark 
          up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. 
          The enclosing tags can make a bit of content into a hyperlink to link to another page on the web,
           italicize words, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:
        </p>
           <code>My cat is very grumpy.
</code>
      
      If we wanted the line to stand by itself, 
      we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph element:
        <code>&lt;<span class="code-entity">p</span>&gt;My cat is very grumpy.&lt;<span class="code-entity">/p</span>&gt;
</code>
      
     </article>

 </section>

 <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">
     <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>

     <article>
       <p> The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
     </article>
     <p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and 
            closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — 
            in this case where the paragraph begins.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. 
            Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>The element:</b> The opening tag, the closing tag and the content together comprise the element.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

    Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:
    <code>&lt;<span class="code-entity">p</span> <span class="attributes">class=</span>"<span class="entities">editor-note</span>"<span class="code-entity"></span>&gt;My cat is very grumpy.&lt;<span class="code-entity">/p</span>&gt;
</code>
  <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual 
      content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. 
      The class attribute allows you to give the element an identifier that can be used later to target 
      the element with style information and other things.</p>

      An attribute should always have the following:
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already 
                has one or more attributes).
              </li>
              <li>
                The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
              </li>
              <li>
                The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
              </li>
          </ol>
      </p>
  </section>

    <header>Nesting elements</header>
    <article>
        <p>
            You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state
             that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <span class="entities">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element, which 
            means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:
        </p>
        <code>&lt;<span class="code-entity">p</span>&gt;My cat is &lt;<span class="code-entity">strong</span>&gt;very&lt;<span class="code-entity">/strong</span>&gt; grumpy.&lt;<span class="code-entity">/p</span>&gt;	
</code>
        You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above,
         we opened the <span class="entities">&lt;p&gt;</span> element first, then the
          <span class="entities">&lt;strong&gt;</span> 
         element; therefore, we have to close the <span class="entities">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element first,
          then the <span class="entities">&lt;p&gt;</span> element. The following is incorrect:
      
    
    <code>&lt;<span class="code-entity">p</span>&gt;My cat is &lt;<span class="code-entity">strong</span>&gt;very grumpy.&lt;<span class="code-entity">/p</span>&gt;&lt;<span class="code-entity">/strong</span>&gt;	
</code>
    <p>The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another.
     If they overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were 
     trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!The elements have to open and close

        <article>
            <p>
                Some elements have no content and are called empty elements.
                 Take the <span class="entities">&lt;img&gt;</span> element that we already have in our HTML page:
           </p>
             
         
         If we wanted the line to stand by itself, 
         we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph element:
           <code>&lt;<span class="code-entity">img</span> <span class="attributes">src</span>="<span class="entities">images/firefox-icon.png</span>" <span class="attributes">src</span>="<span class="entities">My test image</span>"&gt;
</code>
         <p>
            This contains two attributes, but there is no closing &lt;img&gt; tag and no inner content. 
            This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it.
             Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.
         </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_document">
        <header>Anatomy of an HTML document</header>
   
        <article>
            <p>
                That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own.
                 Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page.
                  Let's revisit the code we put into our index.html example (which we first met in the 
                  Dealing with files article):
           </p>
              <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>&lt;<span class="code-entity">html</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="code-entity">head</span>&gt;
       &lt;<span class="code-entity">meta</span> <span class="attributes">charset</span>="<span class="entities">utf-8</span>"&gt;       
       &lt;<span class="code-entity">title</span>&gt;My technical documentaion page&lt;/<span class="code-entity">title</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="code-entity">/head</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="code-entity">body</span>&gt;
      &lt;<span class="code-entity">img</span> <span class="attributes">src</span>="<span class="entities">images/firefox-icon.png</span>" <span class="attributes">src</span>="<span class="entities">My test image</span>"&gt;
    &lt;<span class="code-entity">/body</span>&gt; 
    &lt;<span class="code-entity">/html</span>&gt;</code>
         
    <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; - the doctype. It is required preamble. 
            In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant
             to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered 
             good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things.
              However these days, they don't do much, and are basically just needed to make sure
               your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.	
        </li>
        <li>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt; - This element wraps all the content on the entire page and
             is sometimes known as the root element.	
        </li>
        <li>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; - This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to 
            include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. 
            This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search 
            results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations and more.	
        </li>
        <li>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; - This element sets the character set your document should use 
            to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. 
            Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason
             not to set this and it can help avoid some problems later on.	
        </li>
        <li>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; - This sets the title of your page, which is the title that 
            appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when
             you bookmark/favourite it.	
        </li>
        <li>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; - This contains all the content that you want to show to web users 
            when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks 
            or whatever else.

            <p>
                Let's turn our attention to the <span class="entities">&lt;img&gt;</span> element again:
           </p>
              <code>&lt;<span class="code-entity">img</span> <span class="attributes">src</span>="<span class="entities">images/firefox-icon.png</span>" <span class="attributes">src</span>="<span class="entities">My test image</span>"&gt;
         </code>
         
         <p>As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this 
             via the src (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.</p>
        <p>We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In this attribute, you specify descriptive
            text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:</p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools 
                called screen readers to read out the alt text to them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try
                deliberately changing the path inside your src attribute to make it incorrect. If you save
                and reload the page, you should see something like this in place of the image:
              </li>
          </ol>
          <img id="test" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9349/alt-text-example.png" alt="My test image" class="center">     
            
          <p>
            The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the 
            reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example,
             our current text of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our
             Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."
          </p>
          <p>
            Try coming up with some better alt text for your image now.

    <section class="main-section" id="Headings">
        <header>Headings
        </header>
   
        <article>
        <p>
             Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — 
                or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles and 
                subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, <span class="entities">&lt;h1&gt;</span>-<span class="entities">&lt;h6&gt;</span>, 
                    although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:
           </p>
              <code>&lt;<span class="code-entity">h1</span>&gt;My main title&lt;<span class="code-entity">/h1</span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="code-entity">h2</span>&gt;My top level heading&lt;<span class="code-entity">/h2</span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="code-entity">h3</span>&gt;My subheading&lt;<span class="code-entity">/h3</span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="code-entity">h4</span>&gt;My sub-subheading&lt;<span class="code-entity">/h4</span>&gt;
</code>
         
<p>Now try adding a suitable title to your HTML page just above your <span class="entities">&lt;img&gt;</span> element.</p>

        <article>
            <p>
                As explained above, <span class="entities">&lt;p&gt;</span> elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these 
                    frequently when marking up regular text content:
           </p>

        Add your sample text (you should have it from What should your website look like?) into one or a
         few paragraphs, placed directly below your <span class="entities">&lt;img&gt;</span> element.

            <p>
                A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these.
                 Marking up lists always consist of at least 2 elements. The most common list types 
                 are ordered and unordered lists:
           </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Unordered lists</b> are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping
             list. These are wrapped in a <span class="entities">&lt;ul&gt;</span> element.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Ordered lists</b> are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe.
            These are wrapped in a <span class="entities">&lt;ol&gt;</span> element.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Each item inside the lists is put inside an <span class="entities">&lt;li&gt;</span> (list item) element.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following paragraph fragment into a list
    </p>

    <code>&lt;<span class="code-entity">p</span>&gt;At Mozilla, we’re a global community of technologists, thinkers, and builders working together ... &lt;<span class="code-entity">/p</span>&gt;
    </code>
    <p>
        We could modify the markup to this
    </p>
    <code>&lt;<span class="code-entity">p</span>&gt;At Mozilla, we’re a global community of&lt;<span class="code-entity">/p</span>&gt;
   &lt;<span class="code-entity">ul</span>&gt;
      &lt;<span class="code-entity">li</span>&gt;technologists&lt;<span class="code-entity">/li</span>&gt;
      &lt;<span class="code-entity">li</span>&gt;thinkers&lt;<span class="code-entity">/li</span>&gt;
      &lt;<span class="code-entity">li</span>&gt;builders&lt;<span class="code-entity">/li</span>&gt;

&lt;<span class="code-entity">p</span>&gt;working together ...&lt;<span class="code-entity">/p</span>&gt;

            <p>
                Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use
                 a simple element — <span class="entities">&lt;a&gt;</span> — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your
                      paragraph into a link, follow these steps:
           </p>

           <ol>
               <li>
                Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".
               </li>
               <li>
                Wrap the text in an <span class="entities">&lt;a&gt;</span> element, as shown below:
               </li>
           
            <code> &lt;<span class="code-entity">a</span>&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;<span class="code-entity">/a</span>&gt;
</code>
                   <li>
                    Give the <span class="entities">&lt;a&gt;</span> element an href attribute, as shown below:
         </li>
         <code> &lt;<span class="code-entity">a</span> <span class="attributes">href</span>=""&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;<span class="code-entity">/a</span>&gt;
</code>
<li>
    Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to link to:
</li>
<code> &lt;<span class="code-entity">a</span> <span class="attributes">href</span>="<span class="entities">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/</span>"&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;<span class="code-entity">/a</span>&gt;
</code>
        </ol>
         <p>You might get unexpected results if you omit the https:// or http:// part, called the protocol, 
             at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending 
             you where you wanted it to.</p>
             <p>
                Add a link to your page now, if you haven't already done so.
